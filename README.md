# React Audio Player

A simple audio player built with React that allows users to upload audio files, create playlists, and play audio tracks. The player remembers the last playing audio file and continues playback from the last position even after the page is reloaded.

## Features

- Upload audio files (e.g., mp3 format) to create a playlist.
- Play audio files from the playlist.
- Automatically continue playback from the last position of the last playing audio file upon page reload.
- Standard HTML audio player controls for playback.

3. Install dependencies:

Click on the "Choose File" button to upload audio files and create a playlist.
